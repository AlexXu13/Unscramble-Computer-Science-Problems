Task0:
    The operation includes: 
    Four list index:O(1) 
    So Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(1)
     
Task1: 
    The operation includes: 
    for loop1 includes 2 set add O(1): O(2n)
    for loop2 includes 2 set add O(1): O(2n)
    one length : O(1)
    So Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n)
 
Task2:
    The operation includes: 
    One for loop includes two "k in d" of dictionary O(1): O(2*2*n)
    one dict max: O(n)
    So Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(n)

 
Task3: 
    The operation includes: 
    One for loop : includes 7 set operations O(7n)
    one list sorted: O(nlog(n))
    So Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(nlog(n))


Task4: 
    The operation includes: 
    four for loop : includes set operations O(4n)
    one list sorted: O(nlog(n))
    So Worst Case Big-O Notation: O(nlog(n))
